# Data-Science-Portfolio

This is a repository with some of my data science projects dedicated to showcase my interest, passion and skills in the world of data. These projects have been made using Python. 

## [Yelp Explatory Data Analysis](https://github.com/ccalixwoc/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Yelp%20NLP%20Analysis/Yelp-Review-NLP-Analysis.ipynb)

### Objectives:
* Run a sentiment analysis customer reviews
* Explore and visualize common words according to both positive and negative reviews
* Create a classification model to detect positive and negative reviews



## [Surge Neuroscience Hackathon](https://github.com/ccalixwoc/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Surge-Neuroscience-Hackathon/Surge-Neuroscience-Hackathon.ipynb)
### Objectives:
* Run a proof of concept on attractiveness classification for an interdisciplinary competition, focused on computer science and neuroscience. This project got us the second place of the competition.
* Apply machine learning algorithms for supervised learning applications



## [Psychographic Profiling Using Twitter Data, NLP and ML Techniques]
* Use Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing techniques to create a model to distinguish charitable donors from random users based on social media activity
